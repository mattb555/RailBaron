# RailBaron
Route Calculator for the 1977 Board Game

Rail Baron is a classic board game about earning money via buying railroads and travel accross the USA via rails. Unfortunately, it's a board game that was made in the 70's, and like all board games that were made in the 70s it loves using charts. To find new destinations you need to roll 3 dice to find a region, consult the proper region chart, roll 3 more dice to find the proper city, flip the chart over to the 67x67 lower triangular matrix to find the proper payout for traveling from your current city to this new city.

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that will let you get all the information you need with an average of 1 click.

The initial prototype will be like other similar, exemplified here: http://stevish.com/destinate/destinator.php , but my intention is to create such a site that will set up an initial game, and let players get new routes upon completion of old routes with a single click.
